## Systems Engineer | Hardcore Programmer | Builder

I don’t chase hype. I build systems from the ground up — compilers, frameworks, backends, and infra that actually *run*.  
At 19, I’ve written my own deep learning framework in **C/C++/CUDA**, designed a custom multimodal model (**GRF — Gated Recursive Fusion**), hacked on compilers in **Rust**, and built SaaS products from scratch.  

My code isn’t for show. It’s low-level, fast, and does the job. I don’t make toy projects — I make systems you can build on.

## What I Do

* Write **high-performance systems** in C, C++, and Rust  
* Build **deep learning frameworks and compilers** from scratch  
* Engineer **parallel and GPU systems** with CUDA  
* Design and implement **SaaS backends and full-stack apps** (Go, React, MongoDB)  
* Contribute upstream to open source projects

## Key Projects

**Nawah** — Open source Deep learning framework written in C/Cuda. Minimal, transparent, controllable.  

**TinyC** — Toy compiler in Rust. Lexer, parser, IR, and experiments with optimization.  

**GRF** — Custom model architecture for multimodal fusion. Research-grade, now on hold while I double down on systems.  

**PoktAid** — Offline-first mobile app (React Native) for AI-powered first aid guidance.  

**Markly / SaaS Projects** — Cloud-based knowledge management and AI tooling (Go, React, MongoDB).

## Current Focus

* Systems programming and compiler design  
* GPU programming and parallelization  
* SaaS infrastructure and backend design  
* Making tools that *last* instead of chasing trends

> My GitHub is messy, raw, and real — because the code works. If you want polished marketing repos, look elsewhere. If you want hardcore systems work, you’re in the right place.
