# 👋 Hey, I’m Yusuf Shihata

## 🧠 Researcher. 🔧 Engineer. 🚀 Builder.

I treat deep learning like physics — tear it down, understand the math, rebuild it from scratch.  
At 19, I solo-authored the **Gated Recursive Fusion (GRF)** model — a novel stateful multimodal architecture.  
I’m building **Nawah**, a new deep learning framework from the ground up — think PyTorch, reimagined.  

🛠️ Shipped features to **Hugging Face**.  
🧪 Do research to push frontiers.   
🔥 I don’t just use tools — I build them.

## 🚧 Projects I'm Building

### 🧠 [**Nawah**](https://github.com/vixel2006/nawah)  
A deep learning framework built from first principles — minimal, transparent, and designed for full control. Nawah isn’t a clone; it’s a rethink of how we build and reason about AI systems.

### 🤖 [**GRF**](https://github.com/vixel2006/GRF) (Gated Recursive Fusion)  
My original research model — a stateful multimodal fusion approach. Extension to generation in the works.

### 🩺 [**PoktAid**](https://github.com/vixel/poktAid)  
Offline-first AI-powered mobile app for emergency first aid. Built with React Native.

### 🤝 Hugging Face Transformers  
Contributing features and bugfixes upstream.
