## Systems Engineer | Deep Learning Researcher | Builder

I build software and AI systems that work. Full stop. I **write the frameworks I use**, extend open-source libraries, and push research boundaries. My code isn’t polished for appearances—it works, scales, and does what it’s supposed to do.

I **contribute to Hugging Face**, build **Nawah** from scratch, and experiment with tools that others only talk about. I don’t follow trends—I make tools that matter.

## What I Do

* Build end-to-end systems: **from tensor cores to full AI pipelines**
* Design **multimodal and generative models**
* Optimize and push **Python, C++, CUDA, Rust, Go, React** to their limits
* Build SaaS products and full-stack applications with **MongoDB, Go, React**

---

## Key Projects

**Nawah** — Deep learning framework built from scratch. Minimal, transparent, fully controllable. Not a clone.

**GRF (Gated Recursive Fusion)** — Stateful multimodal fusion model. Extending to generation.

**PoktAid** — Offline-first AI-powered mobile app for emergency first aid.

**Markly / SaaS Projects** — Building cloud-based knowledge management SaaS using Go, React, Langchain, and MongoDB.

**Hugging Face Transformers** — Contributing features, docs, and bug fixes upstream.

> I don’t do PR. I do work that matters. My GitHub is messy, wild, and full of things that actually work. If that bothers you, move along.
