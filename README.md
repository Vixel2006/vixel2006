 # 👋 **Hi, I’m Yusuf Shihata!**  

## 🚀 **About Me**  
I treat deep learning like physics — break it down, rebuild it from scratch. Dropped **Gated Recursive Fusion** at 19, a stateful multimodal model I designed and published solo. Rebuiling PyTorch from scratch, shipped real features to Hugging Face. I train models and break limits — research is the mission, freelance keeps the GPUs fed.


### **🔬 Research Interests**  
- **Machine Learning & AI** → Deep Learning, Generative Models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion), and Multimodal Learning.

## 📈 **Current Projects**  

🔹 **Neura** - A Tensor framework for deep learning purposes using Python and CUDA.

🔹 **transformers** - Open-Source contribution to the huggingface transformers module, working on fixing bugs and implementing new features.

🔹 **GRF** - A new fusion architecture that can do effiecent fusion and scale linearly with number of modalties for limited compute tasks like in robotics and self-driving cars.

🔹 **PoktAid** - A mobile application for ai-assested first aid completely offline for medical reasons.
