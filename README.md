# Hi, I'm Yusuf Shihata 👋

Software Engineer with a strong focus on Computer Science, AI, and high-performance systems. I enjoy building things from first principles — compilers, deep learning frameworks, CUDA kernels, and experimental architectures. I learn fast, move fast, and love solving complex problems with elegant code.
